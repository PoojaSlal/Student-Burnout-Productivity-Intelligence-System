# Student Burnout & Productivity Intelligence System

A data analytics project designed to analyze student behavioral and academic patterns, estimate burnout risk, measure productivity, and generate actionable intervention insights through Python, SQL, and Power BI.

---

## Overview

Student burnout is influenced by multiple factors such as sleep deficit, workload, stress, fatigue, screen distraction, and recovery balance.  
This project builds a complete analytics pipeline that simulates realistic student data, cleans and transforms it, engineers meaningful features, computes burnout and productivity scores, stores the data in a relational database, and visualizes insights using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The system is designed not just to identify extreme burnout, but also to detect students in elevated risk states for early intervention.

---

## Problem Statement

Institutions often lack a structured system to monitor student wellbeing and productivity using behavioral and academic indicators.

This project addresses questions such as:

- Which students are at burnout risk?
- How do workload and recovery affect productivity?
- Which behavioral factors are most associated with burnout?
- How can moderate-risk students be identified before escalation?

---

## Dataset Design

The dataset is built as a daily time-series structure:

- 120 students  
- 90 days  
- 10,000+ records  

Each row represents:
- one student  
- on one day  

### Core Raw Fields

#### Student attributes
- `student_id`
- `department`
- `year_of_study`
- `residence_type`

#### Daily behavior
- `sleep_hours`
- `study_hours`
- `screen_time_hours`
- `social_media_hours`
- `physical_activity_minutes`
- `class_attendance_hours`
- `break_hours`

#### Academic load
- `assignments_due_count`
- `tests_upcoming_count`
- `submission_deadline_proximity`
- `lab_hours`
- `project_work_hours`

#### Wellbeing
- `stress_level`
- `mood_score`
- `fatigue_level`
- `motivation_score`

---

## Data Cleaning

The raw dataset intentionally includes realistic imperfections to simulate real-world analytics challenges.

### Cleaning steps performed
- standardized mixed date formats  
- converted inconsistent stress values like `"7/10"` and `"High"`  
- handled missing values using mean/median imputation  
- removed duplicate student-date records  
- capped unrealistic outliers  
- converted features to consistent numeric types  

### Result
- raw rows: **11016**  
- cleaned rows: **10661**  

---

## Feature Engineering

The following derived features were created:

- `sleep_deficit`
- `workload_index`
- `distraction_ratio`
- `recovery_balance`
- `deadline_pressure_score`
- `productivity_score`
- `burnout_risk_score`
- `academic_performance_index`

---

## Burnout Scoring Logic

Burnout risk is modeled as a weighted combination of normalized stress-inducing and recovery-related factors.

### Burnout score formula

```text
burnout_risk_score =
    0.17 * sleep_deficit_scaled
  + 0.20 * stress_scaled
  + 0.16 * fatigue_scaled
  + 0.16 * workload_index_scaled
  + 0.10 * deadline_pressure_scaled
  + 0.08 * distraction_ratio_scaled
  - 0.08 * recovery_balance_scaled
  - 0.05 * mood_scaled
```
### Interpretation

- stress, fatigue, workload, and sleep deficit increase burnout risk  
- recovery balance and mood reduce burnout risk  
- final score is clipped to the range **0–100**  

---

## Classification System

### Primary classification
- **Low**: 0–39  
- **Moderate**: 40–69  
- **High**: 70–100  

### Detailed classification
- **Very Low**: 0–19  
- **Low**: 20–39  
- **Moderate**: 40–54  
- **Elevated**: 55–69  
- **High**: 70–84  
- **Critical**: 85–100  

### Design insight
The detailed classification helps identify students in the **Elevated** range, which is useful for early intervention before they move into high burnout states.

---

## SQL Database Design

The processed data is normalized into a relational schema:

### Tables

#### `dim_students`
Static student information  

#### `fact_daily_metrics`
Daily behavior and routine metrics  

#### `fact_academic_load`
Academic pressure and workload metrics  

#### `fact_intelligence_scores`
Engineered features, productivity, and burnout outputs  

This design makes the project more scalable and system-oriented instead of relying on a single flat table.

## Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard includes:

### KPI cards
- Total Students  
- Average Burnout Score  
- Average Productivity Score  

### Visuals
- Burnout category distribution  
- Detailed burnout level distribution  
- Average burnout by department  
- Workload vs productivity scatter analysis  
- At-risk student intervention table  

### Interactivity
- slicers for:
  - department  
  - year  
  - residence type  

---

## Key Insights

- Most observations fall into **Low** and **Moderate** burnout categories  
- The **Elevated** group is especially important for early detection  
- Burnout patterns are more strongly linked to behavioral factors such as workload, sleep, and recovery than to department alone  
- Productivity does not increase indefinitely with workload and may decline at higher stress levels  
- The intervention table helps identify students requiring attention based on detailed burnout classification
